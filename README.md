# Webpack 4 dev mode

Webpack transpiles, minifies, and bundles all webapp elements and lets you use all the latest npm libraries like axios and JavaScript features like import, async/await, iterators, etc.

Will launch webpack development server in auto-update on change mode.

Update /etc/hosts to add - this is so you can add a domain to use google services which don't support localhost, i.e., auth, etc.

```
127.0.0.1 app-localhos.com
```

npm start

Will auto launch the app in the browser at the following url.

http://app-localhost.com:9000
